# 🏊 SwimMarks

A dead-simple daily swim log that turns consistency into competition.

## 🌟 Features

- **Daily Swim Logging**: Log your swim in seconds with pool-length increments
- **Streak System**: Build and maintain your swimming streak
- **Weekly Leaderboard**: Compete against demo swimmers
- **Badges & Milestones**: Earn achievements for consistency
- **PWA Support**: Install as an app on your device
- **100% Local Storage**: Your data stays on your device

## 🎯 Philosophy

SwimMarks is built on four principles:
1. **Consistency beats intensity** - Showing up daily matters more than swimming far or fast
2. **Honest logging matters** - Distances feel real and swimmer-native, not gamed
3. **Emotion > data** - Streaks, rank movement, and loss aversion matter more than charts
4. **Low friction, high integrity** - Logging is fast but never sloppy
